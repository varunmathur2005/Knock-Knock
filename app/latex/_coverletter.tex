\lettersection{About Me}
As a senior Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo, I have honed my skills in software development and data analysis through various internship experiences and projects. My primary expertise lies in programming languages such as **Python**, **TypeScript**, **C++**, and frameworks like **React.js** and **Node.js**. With a robust foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I am passionate about building innovative solutions that improve operational efficiencies and enhance user experiences.

\lettersection{Why Company?}
The opportunity to join a pioneering company deeply resonates with my career aspirations. Your commitment to [XYZ industry] innovation aligns with my interests in developing scalable and high-performing applications. The role provides an ideal platform to leverage state-of-the-art technologies and collaborate with forward-thinking professionals, which excites me as I look to contribute towards trailblazing projects that push industry boundaries.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
My experience as an Engineering & Data Insights Intern at Alaan (YC W23) has equipped me with the skills necessary to thrive in this role. There, I engineered a system that leveraged **OpenAI API** and **AWS** to optimize data processing, enhancing accuracy by 30%. I have a proven track record of improving software performance and user engagement, exemplified by significant achievements in enhancing SpeedMart’s platform with **React.js**, resulting in a 15% increase in user engagement. Additionally, my project work on ‘Knock-Knock’ showcases my ability to streamline job application processes, which speaks to my capability in creating efficient, user-centered applications leveraging modern tech stacks, including **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.

I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to your team and would be grateful for consideration for this role or any other positions where my skills may be a good fit.
